	<h2>Open Source</h2>
	We are commited to using and creating the highest quality open source software.&nbsp;
	This means that	the tools used for your project are freely available and therefore any
	continuing development on your project doesn&#039;t require buying expensive proprietary
	software and therefore limiting your choice of developers.&nbsp; It also ensures that
	while the software written is tailored to your specific needs, you will also benefit
	from continued development on the software that your project is based on.

	<h2>Location</h2>
	We are a Bristol based company that can take on projects throughout the South-West as
	well as further afield for more specialized undertakings.
