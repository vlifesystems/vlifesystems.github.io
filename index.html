			<h2>New Projects</h2>
			<p>vLife Systems is currently undergoing an intense period of Research and Development 
			and is therefore not taking on any new projects.&nbsp; We hope to be available by the
			end of May 2010.</p>
			
			<h2>Open Source</h2>
			<p>We are commited to using and creating the highest quality open source software.&nbsp;
			This means that	the tools used for your project are freely available and therefore any
			continuing development on your project doesn&#039;t require buying expensive proprietary
			software and therefore limiting your choice of developers.&nbsp; It also ensures that 
			while the software written is tailored to your specific needs, you will also benefit 
			from continued development on the software that your project is based on.</p>
