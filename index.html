  <h3>Bespoke Software Development</h3>
  We are able to provide a range of software development services for small-medium size
  projects.&nbsp; Each project will be customized to meet your requirements and can
  benefit from ongoing support.

  <h3>Data Scraping and Web Scraping</h3>
  We specialize in custom data extraction from web pages, data files and legacy data source.
  This can be from structured data containing semantic meaning such as databases
  and web pages marked-up with Microdata or Microformats, as well as from sources not originally
  intended to ease this.

  <h3>Automation</h3>
  If you have a task that you find yourself often repeating over and over, we can create software to automate this and relieve you to do something else.

  <h3>Open Source</h3>
  We are committed to using and creating the highest quality open source software.&nbsp;
  This means that the tools used for your project are freely available, easily maintainable and more secure.&nbsp;  In the long-run it will expand your access to developers, ensuring the longevity of your project.

  <p>While the software written is tailored to your specific needs, you will also benefit from continued development on the software that your project is based upon.</p>

  <h3>Location</h3>
  We are a Bristol based company that can take on projects throughout the South-West as
  well as further afield for more specialized undertakings.<br />
