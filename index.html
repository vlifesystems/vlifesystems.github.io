  <h2>Bespoke Software Development</h2>
  We are able to provide a range of software development services for small-medium size
  projects.&nbsp; Each project will be customized to meet your requirements and can
  benefit from ongoing support.

  <h2>Data Scraping and Web Scraping</h2>
  We specialize in custom data extraction from web pages, data files and legacy data source.
  This can be from structured data containing semantic meaning such as databases
  and web pages marked-up with Microdata or Microformats, as well as from sources not originally
  intended to ease this.

  <h2>Legacy Systems</h2>
  We have facilities for custom data conversion and migration
  so that customers can move their data from older systems to newer ones.
  In addition, we are able to maintain, extend, and re-write legacy
  software.

  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  We are committed to using and creating the highest quality open source software.&nbsp;
  This means that the tools used for your project are freely available and therefore any
  continuing development on your project doesn&#039;t require buying expensive proprietary
  software and therefore limiting your choice of developers.&nbsp; It also ensures that
  while the software written is tailored to your specific needs, you will also benefit
  from continued development on the software that your project is based on.

  <h2>Location</h2>
  We are a Bristol based company that can take on projects throughout the South-West as
  well as further afield for more specialized undertakings.<br />
